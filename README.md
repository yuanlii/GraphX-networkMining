# Graph Mining Project
This project uses networkx to predict node linkages and attributes. Two main initiatives are:

Built a system to predict the top 50K linkage of nodes from a large social network with more than 600 million nodes; Predicted node attributes in network based on homophily evaluation of the graph, and reached an accuracy score of 78%
